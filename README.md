# DRL-Rollerball-Unity
In this example, I created an agent Rollerball in Unity environment capable of controlling a ball on a platform and made Rollerball scene a Unity executable. 

Then I trained the agent to roll the ball toward the cube while avoiding falling off the platform, using my own DRL algorithms, including PPO, DDPG.
